            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Due to the nature of beverage service, which prohibits the resale or restocking of prepared drinks, full
              refunds are only available prior to drink preparation. Users may request a full refund only if the
              beverage has not yet been made.

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Each refund request is reviewed individually and is not guaranteed. All refund decisions are final and at
              the sole discretion of SpLine or the partner venue, depending on timing and circumstances.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Refunds may be issued on a case-by-case basis under the following conditions:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 ml-4">
              <li>At the discretion of the bartender or partner venue staff</li>
              <li>Entry to the participating venue is denied, preventing the user from retrieving the beverage</li>
              <li>The requested beverage is unavailable due to inventory limitations at the partner venue</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
